Extension Libraries for Essence#

The REQUIRED location is %EssenceSharpPath%\Source\Libraries\Extensions.lib (i.e., the parent folder must be Libraries.)

This repository contains Essence# class libraries which extend the Essence# Standard Library, are distributed as part of the standard Essence# distribution, but which are not loaded by default.

It also contains "compatibility libraries" which may contain code that adds compatibility classes/methods for specific foreign implementation platforms.
