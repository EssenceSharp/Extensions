Extension Libraries for Essence#

The default location of the Essence# Extensions Library is %EssenceSharpPath%\Source\Libraries\Extensions.lib. The name of the folder that contains it must be Extensions.lib, and by default that folder resides at %EssenceSharpPath%\Source\Libraries. But the Extensions Library (i.e, the Contributions.lib folder) may reside at any location specified as one one of the library search paths by the set of of active configuration profiles.

This repository contains Essence# class libraries which extend the Essence# Standard Library, are distributed as part of the standard Essence# distribution, but which are not loaded by default.

It also contains "compatibility libraries" which may contain code that adds compatibility classes/methods for specific foreign implementation platforms.
